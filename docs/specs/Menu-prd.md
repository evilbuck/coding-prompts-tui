# Menu Panel

Create a footer in the interface. This is a single line with some padding.
The text inside the footer will be menu items that are dynamic.

For the MVP, the only item needs to be  "menu". If bubbletea has a button, use that.
Each button in the footer will have a shortcut. The "menu" button will be "x".

Pressing the "x" will activate the menu. For now, just use a notifier like bubbleup https://github.com/DaltonSW/BubbleUp that says, "menu activated"

The focus is creating the footer and the menu binding.
