# Scrollable Prompt Preview

The goal is to make the prompt preview floating panel view scrollable.
When the content overflows, it should be scrollable with a mouse/trackpad 
or keyboard up/down arrows or pgup/pgdown

**Other Features**

The bottom of the preview window should have a character counter. Make it a footer. See if bubbletea has something that would make this easier.
