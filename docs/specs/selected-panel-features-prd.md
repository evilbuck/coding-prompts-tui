# Remove selected files

In the @internal/tui/selected.go and @internal/tui/app.go, add the functionality to remove the selected file from the SelectedFilesModel.

This can be done by pressing spacebar when the selected file in the selected files panel is highlighted or "selected".

Add a footer to the panel with helpful text that says press spacebar to deselect when a file is selected. The text should be contextual.
